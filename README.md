This is my incomplete space RTS should be on mobile devices. Although it's more mine playground then a complete game.

Points I've done here:
- nGUI experience
- Flexible 2d camera controller (mouse and touch)
- My own collision system with QuadTree
- Steering behaviours (arrive, separation, cohesion)
- AI with weights
- Pathfinding with BFS
- Config system to work with Type Object pattern
- ObjectPool
- Basic card system
- Profiling to use the game on legacy mobile devices (Android for now)

Attention! The game could be similar to Mushroom Wars.
